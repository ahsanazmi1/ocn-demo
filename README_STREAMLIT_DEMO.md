# OCN ML-Powered Payment Demo

This Streamlit demo showcases the complete Open Checkout Network (OCN) payment flow with ML-powered agents making intelligent decisions at each step.

## üéØ Demo Overview

The demo walks through a complete payment transaction with the following steps:

### Step 0: Cart Creation
- **Actor**: AI Assistant (ChatGPT)
- **Flow**: User requests "Buy two slim-fit Crew Oxfords (M) and a navy blazer"
- **Result**: Cart created with $380 total (Oxfords x2 + Blazer)

### Step 1: Pre-Auth Checks
- **Okra (Credit Agent)**: Offers credit options including BNPL, runs ML-powered risk scoring
- **Onyx (Trust Agent)**: Runs trust/compliance checks, returns trust score + signals

### Step 2: Negotiation
- **Opal (Wallet Agent)**: Negotiates on consumer's behalf (lowest fees, loyalty maximization)
- **Orca (Checkout Agent)**: Negotiates on merchant's behalf (highest approval rates, lowest interchange)
- **Olive (Loyalty Agent)**: Surfaces loyalty opportunities ("5% rewards on store card")

### Step 3: Fee Competition
- **Weave (Processor Agent)**: Detects multi-bank routing, runs live fee auction across processors
- **Result**: Returns ranked fee outcomes with transparency

### Step 4: Finalization
- **Orca (Checkout Agent)**: Consolidates all inputs, creates PaymentMandate
- **Result**: Optimal configuration balancing all agent inputs

### Step 5: Auth & Post-Auth
- **Processor + Bank**: Authorization response
- **Weave (Audit)**: Logs decision, auction, and outcome trace
- **Transparency**: Consumer sees complete decision breakdown

## ü§ñ ML-Powered Features

Each agent uses machine learning models for decision making:

- **Okra**: XGBoost Credit Risk v2.1 - Credit scoring and risk assessment
- **Onyx**: TrustNet v1.3 - Trust and compliance evaluation
- **Opal**: ConsumerPreferenceNet v1.2 - Consumer preference optimization
- **Orca**: MerchantOptimizer v2.0 - Merchant-side optimization
- **Olive**: LoyaltyOptimizer v1.5 - Loyalty and retention optimization
- **Weave**: AuctionOptimizer v2.3 - Fee auction and processor selection
