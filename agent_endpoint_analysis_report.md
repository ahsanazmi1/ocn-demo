### 3. **Mock vs Real Patterns**
- **Mock Indicators**: Static data, sample responses, hardcoded values
- **Real Indicators**: Dynamic IDs, timestamps, confidence scores, model provenance
- **Mixed Agents**: Real policy engines with mock data sources

### 4. **Service Reliability**
- 7/8 agents running successfully
- Oasis service down (needs investigation)
- 53.1% endpoint success rate (many require proper payloads)

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Actions**
- Investigate and restart Oasis service
- Document proper payload formats for endpoints returning 422 errors
- Add input validation and error handling improvements

### 2. **Development Priorities**
- Enhance Orca's ML/LLM capabilities (already excellent)
- Improve Opal's spend control algorithms
- Expand Onyx's trust scoring with more ML features
- Add real ML/LLM to Olive's policy evaluation

### 3. **Testing Improvements**
- Create comprehensive test suites with proper payloads
- Add performance monitoring for ML/LLM endpoints
- Implement automated endpoint health checks

## Conclusion

The OCN ecosystem shows a **healthy mix of real implementations and mock services**. Orca stands out as the primary ML/LLM-powered agent with full Azure OpenAI integration, while other agents implement real policy-based logic with varying degrees of sophistication. The system demonstrates a solid foundation for production deployment with clear areas for enhancement.

**Overall Assessment**: **Production-Ready with Real ML/LLM Core** üöÄ
